# Monster Database

Academic Java project that reads a CSV file listing monsters,
and connects to a database to populate it with monster information.

Troubleshooting project:
mvn validate
mvn clean
mvn eclipse:clean
mvn compile


Note to self: this was useful for initial Maven path configuration in the Eclipse dot files:
mvn eclipse:eclipse
